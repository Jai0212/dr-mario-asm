# Dr. Mario Assembly Project

## Overview
This project is a reimplementation of the classic **Dr. Mario** game using assembly language. It features core gameplay mechanics such as virus elimination, pill stacking, and level progression.

## Features
- **Virus Elimination:** Stack pills of the same color to eliminate viruses.
- **Gravity Mechanics:** Pills fall naturally, and broken halves continue to drop.
- **Level Progression:** Increasing difficulty as viruses multiply.
- **Score Tracking:** Keeps track of player progress.
- **Optimized Performance:** Efficient use of assembly instructions to enhance gameplay.

## Milestones Achieved
- Implemented basic rendering of the playfield.
- Developed pill movement and collision logic.
- Added virus spawning and elimination mechanics.
- Integrated gravity for pill halves.
- Designed a scoring system and level advancement.

## Technologies Used
- **Assembly Language**: Low-level programming for precise control over the game logic.
- **Graphics Rendering**: Custom implementation for sprite handling.
- **Memory Management**: Optimized for minimal resource usage.
